                <h2>Jonathan Grommesh...</h2>
                <p>is my name. Jon Grom for short. I am a soon-to-be certified full-stack web developer, specializing in MERN stack applications, as well as a fiction writer, musical director, and aspiring neuroscientist, pursuing my bachelors degree at the Univerty of Minnesota: Twin Cites. I indulge in a variety of hobbies, including but not limited to: piano playing, board games, volleyball, bouldering, reading, writing, and theatre. In a world of specialists I am a generalist, and have found that the skills I pick up from one domain serve me across all others in thrillingly unexpected ways. This has served me well in my several managerial service roles and freelance musical directing career. My one passion, if I were forced to choose, would not just be learning, but applying my knowledge beyond its initial scope and onward towards new horizons.</p>
