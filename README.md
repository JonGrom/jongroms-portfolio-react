# React Portfolio

In this project, I built a portfolio using REACT and Vite as a compiler. I used react-router to make four pages: about me, contact, portfolio, and resume. 

The about me page contains an image of myself and a bio, the contact page contains a form with gesture functions utilizing useState for error handling, a portfolio with iterative rendering of projects components which utilize prop drilling, and the resume page contains an embedded, downloadable pdf. 

!!Importantly, the resume page does not yet recognize the content of the resume, which is okay in my eyes because my resume needs to be reworked anyways, but I will update this in the future. The download still works. 

Header and Footer components contain navigation links as well as links to personal social accounts. The final product was deployed to netlify.

The app was designed with mobile-first in mind, so (as much as it needs a styling rework) it looks best on narrower screens.
